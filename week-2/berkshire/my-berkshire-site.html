- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was encouraging to see that my level of html knowledge is capable of making a functioning site that could be used by a large company.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements? Fun if you can stay focused, it is potentially overwhelming because there are a huge amount of resources available to help with HTML5.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
It was difficult, we had to remind ourselves that the H1-H6 is a designation of importance rather than size because it will all be changes in css.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
I like HTML so far because it has a balance and organization that is very literal and linear. The limitations of it are also nice because it keeps me on track rather than worrying too much about design elements.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
most of the tags say what they do so that makes things pretty good from the start. I suppose practice and writing them out on notecards will get the rest of the job done.
