## Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
In your GitHub profile screen click the Repository tab then the Add New button. Give it a title and description, decide if it's public or private and if you want a read me or license (in this case public, yes, and yes) You now have a repository, view it and copy its link so you can clone it to your computer.
To clone your repository to your local drive open a shell, check where you are with pwd and navigate to the folder you want to save it in. use the git clone <URL> command with your copied link as the <URL>. It is now cloned to your computer.

## Describe what open source means.
Open source is software made by kindly programmers who choose to make their source code public so anybody can play with or modify without getting sued for copyright infringement.

## What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
As a student and a curious person I love the idea of Open Source code because I can study and change programs. We live in a greedy world and it feels so counterintuitive to release something for free for everyone but hopefully that will become more a part of our global society and it can advance an individual's piece of coding a lot to have endless others add to it.

## Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses can also be important to protect programs with sensative uses or information or to generate the income needed to sustain a business or individual programmer.

## What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
This exercise helped to cement my abilities working with branches and git. I did have several aha moments as it worked.

## Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
